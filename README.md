## Introduction
The project aims to help people who don't have time to plan themselves their nutrition and they don't have a kind of money to pay a professional. By itself it's a study project and doesn't claim to be a professional alternative.

## Functioning
The platform will allow the user to browse recipes, check their nutritional value and add them into their daily plans that later on can be passed to monthly plan thanks to session management and login mechanism provided by Passport. The recipes and nutritional evaluation will come from EDAMAM API, our app allows to save the results into plans by integrating it with Google Calendar.
